# Species Counterpoint Generator

This web app will allow users to input a cantus firmus (CF) and generate a counterpoint in a selected species (1st to 5th species of counterpoint). The app will provide the user with an interactive interface to visualize the cantus firmus and counterpoint, play back the melody, and manually adjust the notes.
